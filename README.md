# Flipper Zero DIY Project
This project was intended to clone the flipper zero, by cloning components and pcb. 

# Info
After almost recreating the whole schematic of the open source Flipper Zero schematics
[https://docs.flipper.net/development/hardware/schematic](https://docs.flipper.net/development/hardware/schematic)
I checked the pricing for parts and because of the form factor factory assambling.

# Pricing
- electronical parts: 	ca. 50€-60€ (54.44$-65.32$)
- pcb (at jlcpcb):			
	- PCB creation:	2$
	- PCB assembly: 65.71$
	- shipping:	ca. 15$
	- probably all x2 because of different pcb designs on cheapest format

## TOTAL ca. 220$
