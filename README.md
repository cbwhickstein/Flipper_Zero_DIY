# Flipper Zero DIY Project (NOT FINISHED)
This project was intended to clone the flipper zero, by cloning components and pcb.

If you want to contribute to this project please do so in a new Fork of this project and have fun. :D


# Info
After almost recreating the whole schematic of the open source Flipper Zero schematics
[https://docs.flipper.net/development/hardware/schematic](https://docs.flipper.net/development/hardware/schematic)
I checked the pricing for parts and because of the form factor and factory assambling **the price of creating a DIY Flipper would exeed the 
price of a bought one**.

# Pricing
- electronical parts: 	ca. 50€-60€ (54.44$-65.32$)
- pcb (at jlcpcb):			
	- PCB creation:	2$
	- PCB assembly: 65.71$
	- shipping:	ca. 15$
	- probably all x2 because of different pcb designs on cheapest format

## TOTAL ca. 220$
